<h1><center><span style="color:#2874A6">Vission of Organ Donation</span></center></h1>



<h5>
Our vision is to bridge the gap between the number of people who need organs and the number of people who donate organs.
We are as determined as soldiers are on a mission. These are our aims:

To spread knowledge and awareness that aids in the prevention of kidney and liver diseases.
To spread awareness about cadaver organ donations in the country among the people.
To facilitate the process of organ donations right from procuring the organs from a donor to making sure that the recipient gets a new lease of life.
To instill hope among the people for a new life, even after they have given up.
To convince the families of those patients who are declared brain-dead to donate organs and remove fear from the minds of the people and encourage them to pledge their organs for donation.
To help the people cope with the mental trauma that comes when they are suffering during the diseases.
Networking with hospitals that are capable of handling organ transplantation procedure.
Each and everyone of us at Donate Life contribute our time and energy without any commercial motive, solely for the benefit of the humanity and large.</h5>
