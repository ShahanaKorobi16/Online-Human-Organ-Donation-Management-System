<h1><center><span style="color:#2874A6">Motivation of Organ Donation</span></center></h1>



<h5 class="mt-4">
By donating one's organs and tissue after they die, they can save or improve as many as 75 lives. Many families say that knowing their loved one helped save or improve other lives helped them cope with their loss. It's especially important to consider becoming an organ donor if you belong to an ethnic minority.
Organ Donation is the gift of an organ to a person who needs a transplant to improve his condition and health status. <br>
Some motivations for organ donation were identified: <br>
   1. helping others/altruism, <br>
   2. fulfilling long-cherished wishes, <br>
   3. reducing the burdens, <br>
   4. making the best use of everything, <br>
   5. giving back to society, and <br>
   6. life extension.
